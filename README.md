## Events in the Game:

**Starting the Game:** Each player rolls the dice 3 times, when they roll 6 they can put one pawn from their home onto the board (on its starting tile).

**Rolling the Dice:** Players roll the dice on their turn to determine their movement. If they roll 6 they can either put one pawn onto the board or gain an extra move (they roll again for it).  

**Moving a Pawn:** Depending on the dice result, a pawn moves from its current position to a new one along the track. While moving they can jump over other pawns or if they land on the same tile they can kick them back to their home.

**Placing a New Pawn:** Rolling a six allows a player to bring a new pawn from their home into play. Knocking 

**Out an Opponent:** If your pawn lands on a tile occupied by an opponent’s pawn, their pawn is sent back to their home base.

**Reaching the Center:** A player wins when all their pawns successfully reach the centre of the board.
